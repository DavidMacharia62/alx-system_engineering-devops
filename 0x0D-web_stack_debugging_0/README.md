## Network Basics

### Introduction
Network basics are fundamental concepts and technologies that govern how data is transmitted and received over computer networks. Understanding these principles is essential for building and maintaining network infrastructure.

### Key Concepts
1. **IP Addressing**: IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network. Learn about IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and CIDR notation.

2. **Subnetting**: Subnetting allows you to divide a large IP network into smaller, manageable subnetworks. It helps in efficient resource allocation and routing.

3. **Routing**: Routing involves forwarding data packets between different networks. Learn about routing tables, routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP), and network topologies.

4. **Firewalls and Security**: Understand the role of firewalls in network security. Explore concepts like stateful vs. stateless firewalls and security policies.

5. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. Learn about DNS resolution, types of DNS records, and DNS security.

6. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**: Explore the TCP/IP protocol suite, including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), and their roles in data communication.

## Docker

### Introduction
Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies application packaging and deployment. It allows you to create, deploy, and manage containers, which are lightweight and portable environments.

### Key Concepts
1. **Docker Containers**: Containers are isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies. Learn how to create, run, and manage containers.

2. **Docker Images**: Docker images are templates for containers. Understand how to build, customize, and share Docker images.

3. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Explore how to define services, networks, and volumes using Compose files.

4. **Docker Networking**: Learn about Docker's networking modes, including bridge, host, and overlay networks. Configure network settings for containers.

5. **Docker Volumes**: Docker volumes allow data to persist beyond the lifespan of containers. Discover how to create and manage volumes.

6. **Docker Hub**: Docker Hub is a repository for Docker images. Learn how to find and use existing images from the Docker Hub registry.

## Web Stack Debugging

### Introduction
Web stack debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues in web applications and server environments. Effective debugging skills are crucial for maintaining and troubleshooting web services.

### Key Concepts
1. **Error Handling**: Understand how to handle different types of errors in web applications, including HTTP errors, server errors, and application errors.

2. **Logging**: Implement logging mechanisms to record application events and errors. Learn about log levels and best practices for logging.

3. **Debugging Tools**: Explore debugging tools and techniques, such as browser developer tools, server logs, and code debugging (e.g., using IDEs or debuggers).

4. **Performance Optimization**: Learn how to identify and address performance bottlenecks in web applications, including database queries, code optimization, and caching strategies.

5. **Security Debugging**: Understand common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and how to identify and fix security issues in web applications.

6. **Load Testing**: Perform load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify performance issues before they impact users.
