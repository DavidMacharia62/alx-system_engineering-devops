## Introduction
Web stack debugging is the process of identifying and fixing issues in the software stack that powers a web application. This stack typically includes the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache), application server (e.g., Node.js, Ruby on Rails), and the underlying operating system. Debugging is crucial for maintaining a stable and secure web environment.

Additionally, running software as another user is a common security practice to limit the privileges of a process and reduce the potential impact of security vulnerabilities. In this document, we will explore how to run software as another user using Linux commands.

Lastly, running Nginx as the 'nginx' user is a security best practice to minimize the potential damage that could be done if an attacker gains control of the Nginx process.

## Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves a series of steps to identify and resolve issues in a web application's stack.

### 1. Identifying the Issue
The first step in debugging is to identify the problem. Users or automated monitoring tools may report issues such as slow response times, error messages, or unexpected behavior.

### 2. Reproducing the Issue
Attempt to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment. This helps ensure that the issue is consistent and can be debugged effectively.

### 3. Analyzing Logs
Check server logs (e.g., Nginx access and error logs, application logs) for any error messages or unusual behavior. Logs often provide valuable insights into what went wrong.

### 4. Checking Server Status
Use system monitoring tools (e.g., 'top', 'htop', 'systemctl') to check the resource utilization and the status of the web server and application server processes.

### 5. Inspecting Code
Examine the source code of the web application and server configurations for potential issues. Common problems may include incorrect configurations, unhandled exceptions, or security vulnerabilities.

## Running Software as Another User
Running software as another user can enhance system security by limiting the privileges of a process. Two common methods for achieving this are using the 'su' and 'sudo' commands.

### 1. Introduction
- Running as another user can be done for security reasons or to test how a process behaves under different user privileges.
- Always make sure to have the necessary permissions before attempting to switch users or run commands as other users.

### 2. Using 'su' Command
The 'su' (substitute user) command allows you to switch to another user in a new shell session.

Syntax:
```bash
su - <username>
```

Example:
```bash
su - john
```

You will be prompted to enter the password for the specified user.

### 3. Using 'sudo' Command
The 'sudo' (superuser do) command allows authorized users to execute commands as another user.

Syntax:
```bash
sudo -u <username> <command>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo -u www-data ls /var/www/html
```

The user running the 'sudo' command must have the appropriate permissions in the sudoers file.

## Running Nginx as Nginx
Running Nginx as the 'nginx' user is a security best practice to minimize the potential impact of security vulnerabilities in the Nginx process.

### 1. Introduction
By default, Nginx typically runs as the 'nginx' user. This user has limited permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or damage to the system.

### 2. Configuration
Ensure that the Nginx configuration file specifies the 'nginx' user. The configuration file is usually located at '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'.

```nginx
user nginx;
```

### 3. Starting Nginx
To start Nginx, use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### 4. Verifying Nginx User
To verify that Nginx is running as the 'nginx' user, you can use the 'ps' command:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Check the output for the user column to confirm that Nginx is running as the 'nginx' user.

This README provides an overview of web stack debugging, running software as another user, and running Nginx as the 'nginx' user. Remember to exercise caution when switching users or making changes to system configurations, especially in production environments.
