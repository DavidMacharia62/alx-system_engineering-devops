# Server, SSH, and Bash README

This README provides a brief overview of servers, SSH (Secure Shell), how to create an SSH RSA key pair, how to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair, and the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

## What is a server

A server is a computer or software system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, storing files, managing databases, or delivering email.

## Where servers usually live

Servers can physically reside in data centers, server rooms, or within cloud computing environments. They are designed for continuous operation to ensure high availability and reliability.

## What is SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a network protocol and cryptographic method used to secure remote connections between computers. It encrypts data exchanged between a client and a server, making it a secure way to access and manage remote systems over insecure networks.

## How to create an SSH RSA key pair

To create an SSH RSA key pair, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to generate the key pair, replacing "your_email@example.com" with your email address:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"
