# Web Stack Debugging Readme

## Introduction
This repository contains information on debugging a web stack, particularly focusing on Nginx, to handle pressure and reduce the number of failed requests. The goal is to optimize the web server setup to efficiently handle a large number of requests.

## Issue Description
During the benchmarking process using ApacheBench, it was observed that the current web server setup is experiencing a significant number of failed requests. The test involved sending 2000 requests to the server with 100 requests concurrently. Out of these, 943 requests failed.

## Task
The primary task is to debug the web stack and identify the root cause of the high number of failed requests. By leveraging the logs and employing appropriate debugging techniques, we aim to rectify the issues and bring the count of failed requests to 0.

## Tools Used
1. **Nginx**: The web server software being tested and debugged.
2. **ApacheBench**: A popular tool used for benchmarking web servers by simulating HTTP requests.
3. **Logs**: Crucial for identifying issues and understanding the behavior of the web server under pressure.

## Debugging Process
1. **Log Analysis**: Analyze Nginx logs to understand the specific errors and requests that are failing. Look for patterns or anomalies that might be causing the failures.
2. **Server Configuration Check**: Review the Nginx server configuration for any potential misconfigurations or performance bottlenecks that could be leading to failed requests.
3. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize the Nginx configuration and settings to better handle a high load of requests.
4. **Testing and Validation**: After implementing changes, re-run the benchmarking test using ApacheBench to ensure that the number of failed requests has been reduced to 0.

## Additional Notes
- Regular monitoring and maintenance of the web stack are essential to ensure optimal performance.
- Proper documentation of changes made during the debugging process is crucial for future reference.

## Conclusion
By effectively leveraging the logs and implementing necessary changes in the Nginx setup, we aim to resolve the issues causing the high number of failed requests, thus optimizing the web stack to handle pressure efficiently.

Remember, efficient debugging not only resolves the current issues but also serves as a learning opportunity to improve the overall performance and stability of the web server setup.
