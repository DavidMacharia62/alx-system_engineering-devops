1. **cd** - Change directory: Allows you to navigate through directories. For example, `cd Documents` will move you to the "Documents" directory.

2. **dir** (Windows) or **ls** (Mac/Linux) - List directory contents: Displays the files and folders in the current directory.

3. **mkdir** - Make directory: Creates a new directory. For instance, `mkdir NewFolder` will create a directory named "NewFolder".

4. **rm** (Windows) or **rmdir** (Mac/Linux) - Remove directory: Deletes an empty directory. Use with caution, as it can't be undone. For example, `rm OldFolder` will remove the directory "OldFolder".

5. **del** (Windows) or **rm** (Mac/Linux) - Delete file: Removes a file. Be careful, as this action is irreversible. For instance, `del filename.txt` will delete the file "filename.txt".

6. **copy** (Windows) or **cp** (Mac/Linux) - Copy file: Creates a copy of a file. For example, `copy source.txt destination.txt` will duplicate "source.txt" as "destination.txt".

7. **move** (Windows) or **mv** (Mac/Linux) - Move or rename file: Moves a file from one location to another or renames it. For instance, `move file.txt folder/` will move "file.txt" to the "folder" directory.

8. **echo** - Output text: Prints text to the console. For example, `echo Hello, World!` will display "Hello, World!" in the console.

9. **ping** - Network connection test: Sends a network request to check the connectivity with a specific address. For instance, `ping www.example.com` will test the connection to "www.example.com".

10. **wget** (Windows) or **curl** (Mac/Linux) - Download files from the web: Downloads files from a URL. For example, `wget https://www.example.com/file.zip` will retrieve the file "file.zip" from the given URL.
