This section explains the differences between an application server and a web server, emphasizing their distinct roles in serving web applications and handling various types of content.

## Serving a Flask Application with Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to serve a Flask application using Gunicorn and Nginx on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. The following guide assumes that Gunicorn is installed globally without using a virtual environment.

### Installation

Make sure that the server has the necessary dependencies installed. To install Gunicorn and Nginx globally on Ubuntu 16.04, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

Handling Flask's strict_slashes
Flask's strict_slashes behavior can affect route handling. Ensure that route definitions accommodate this behavior effectively by configuring route definitions as needed.

Upstart Documentation
This section offers comprehensive information about Upstart, which manages processes on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. Learn how to create and manage Upstart scripts for various processes effectively.
